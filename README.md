# JWSolarSystem-Pipelines


All the pipelines used for Solar System extended sources data. For Jupiter, its size, brightness and rotation speed make it a really challenging target. That is why the pipelines have to be modified in order to retrieve the best data quality. All these pipelines work for 1 dither data. The mosaicking is done after the pipeline process with the Level3 cubes.

The integrated desaturation pipeline will be updated very soon.

This was a collaboration between the JWST Solar System team. For more information please go to Jake Harkett's Github:  https://github.com/JHarkett/MIRI-code
